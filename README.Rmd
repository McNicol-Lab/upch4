Code used for in: McNicol G. Fluet-Chouinard E. et al. (2023) *Upscaling wetland methane emissions from the FLUXNET-CH4 eddy covariance network (UpCH4 v1.0): Model development, network assessment, and budget comparison* AGU Advances.


`upch4-full-notebook.Rmd` contains the entire original codebase 
  
`upch4-model-dev-eval.Rmd` contains a simplified workflow for key steps

It is recommended that the file structure in the following directories is replicated when using the latter notebook:

  - `code`
  - `data`
  - `mc`
  - `output`
  
**NOTE** `results`, `code_old` and `data_old` are directories for the older `upch4-full-notebook.Rmd` codebase

Please contact Gavin McNicol with questions about use: gmcnicol@uic.edu
