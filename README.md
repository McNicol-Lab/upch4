Code used for in: McNicol G. Fluet-Chouinard E. et al. (2023) *Upscaling
wetland methane emissions from the FLUXNET-CH4 eddy covariance network
(UpCH4 v1.0): Model development, network assessment, and budget
comparison* AGU Advances.

`upch4-full-notebook.Rmd` contains the entire original codebase

`upch4-model-dev-eval.Rmd` contains a simplified workflow for key steps

It is recommended that the file structure in the following directories
is replicated when using the latter notebook:

- `code`
- `data`
- `mc`
- `output`

**NOTE** `results`, `code_old` and `data_old` are directories for the
older `upch4-full-notebook.Rmd` codebase
